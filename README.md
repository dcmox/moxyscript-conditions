# moxyscript-conditions
MoxyScript Condition Editor. Build conditions that can be cached and evaluated later so you don't have to bother coding them in manually. Special care is used to ensure injections do not find their way through. Conditions can be built on the front end.

## Use
There are examples in the tests folder along with a small demo. This script is still early in development.
